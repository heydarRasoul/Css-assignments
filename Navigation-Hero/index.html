        AI art is artwork created with the assistance of artificial intelligence
        algorithms. These algorithms can generate images, apply artistic styles,
        and even create new visuals by learning patterns from large datasets of
        existing art. The rise of AI art challenges traditional notions of
        creativity and opens new possibilities for artists and designers.

      <p>
        Popular AI techniques include Generative Adversarial Networks<span
          id="gan-defination"
          >( a type of deep learning model that use two neural networks, a
          generator and a discriminator, in a competitive relationship to
          generate realistic data.)</span
        >, neural style transfer, and diffusion models. The result can range
        from surreal landscapes to abstract portraits.
      </p>

      <p>
        In recent years, AI-generated art has moved from experimental labs into
        mainstream culture. Artists use platforms like DALL·E, Midjourney, and
        Stable Diffusion to turn simple text prompts into intricate visual
        pieces. These tools allow anyone — regardless of traditional artistic
        skill — to explore creativity in new ways.
      </p>

      <p>
        AI art is also raising important questions about authorship,
        originality, and the definition of art itself. Who owns an image created
        by a machine? Can a machine truly be creative, or is it simply
        recombining existing ideas? These debates are shaping the future of
        digital art and intellectual property in the age of automation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite the controversy, AI art is undoubtedly pushing the boundaries of
        visual expression. It blends human intention with machine-generated
        execution, offering a glimpse into a future where creativity is
        increasingly collaborative — between people and intelligent systems.
