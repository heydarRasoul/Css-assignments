          AI art is artwork created with the assistance of artificial
          intelligence algorithms. These algorithms can generate images, apply
          artistic styles, and even create new visuals by learning patterns from
          large datasets of existing art. The rise of AI art challenges
          traditional notions of creativity and opens new possibilities for
          artists and designers.

        <p>
          Popular AI techniques include Generative Adversarial Networks<span
            id="gan-defination"
            >( a type of deep learning model that use two neural networks, a
            generator and a discriminator, in a competitive relationship to
            generate realistic data.)</span
          >, neural style transfer, and diffusion models. The result can range
          from surreal landscapes to abstract portraits.
        </p>

        <p>
          In recent years, AI-generated art has moved from experimental labs
          into mainstream culture. Artists use platforms like DALL·E,
          Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion to turn simple text prompts into
          intricate visual pieces. These tools allow anyone — regardless of
          traditional artistic skill — to explore creativity in new ways.
        </p>

        <p>
          AI art is also raising important questions about authorship,
          originality, and the definition of art itself. Who owns an image
          created by a machine? Can a machine truly be creative, or is it simply
          recombining existing ideas? These debates are shaping the future of
          digital art and intellectual property in the age of automation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Despite the controversy, AI art is undoubtedly pushing the boundaries
          of visual expression. It blends human intention with machine-generated
          execution, offering a glimpse into a future where creativity is
          increasingly collaborative — between people and intelligent systems.
